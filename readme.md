## Abstract

To promote the process of architectural standardization and improve construction efficiency, a novel non-diaphragm joint between concrete-filled cold-formed highstrength square steel tubular (CCHSST) columns and composite beams was proposed. Low-cycle loading tests were conducted on four non-diaphragm joint specimens, and the effects of the column wall thickness in the joint zone tj and the height of the column wall thickened area in the joint zone hj on the failure modes, loadbearing capacities, strength and stiffness degradation, ductility, and energy dissipation capacities were investigated. The test results show that as tj increased from 10 mm to 20 mm, the plastic hinge of the non-diaphragm joint gradually moved from the joint zone to the beam, effectively preventing damage to the joint zone. The positive and negative bearing capacities of the specimen increased by 95.12% and 38.51%, respectively, and the positive initial stiffness increased by 48.17%. Meanwhile, the energy dissipation capacity of the specimen significantly improved, while the ductility slightly decreased. As hj increased from 600 mm to 900 mm, the difference in loadbearing capacity and initial stiffness of non-diaphragm joints was between 2.4% and 19.12%, and the changes in energy dissipation capacity and ductility are also minimal. All the non-diaphragm joints tested in this study are semi-rigid and partial strength joints according to Eurocode 3. A simplified method for calculating the skeleton curves of non-diaphragm joints was proposed. The numerical simulation analysis conducted by MSC.MARC indicates that finite element method (FEM) can effectively simulate the hysteresis performance of non-diaphragm joints. It is recommended to adopt the form of the non-diaphragm joint with thickening only in the joint zone. For the thickness of the non-thickened column wall t is 10mm, tj should be 2t and hj should be 1.5hs (where hs is the beam height).
